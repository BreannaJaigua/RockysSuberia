Assignment/Project #: COURSE PROJECT - Binding Bugs

Description:
    Rocky Suberia is a lighthearted mobile game built with Swift and SpriteKit. Players must appease Rocky, a former Michelin-starred European chef who transformed into a colossal kaiju wasp after eating the wrong mysterious ingredient. After crossing the ocean to America, Rocky now roams the continent demanding food offerings. If players fail to feed him properly, he becomes increasingly agitated, and the results are not ideal.
